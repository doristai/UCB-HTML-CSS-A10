# Ensure the environment is activate 
conda activate work

# activate MongoDB

# Open a second terminal browser to check mongo is working 
mongod

# Create Database - create a new database named 'practicedb' and make it our active database
use practicedb


# Typing "db" into a terminal connected to Mongo will returns the name of the database that is currently working in
db

# Insert Data 
db.collectionName.insert({key:value})

'''
- db : active database, practicedb

- collectionName : name of the new collection we're creating (we'll customize it when we practice)

- .insert({}) : how MongoDB knows we're inserting data into the collection

- key:value : the format into which we're inserting our data; its construction is very similar to a Python dictionary
'''

# Find the data inserted 
db.zoo.find() #zoo is the collection in the practice 

# Delete or drop document 
db.collectionName.remove({})

# To remove a collection all together 
db.collectionName.drop()

# To remove the teste database 
bd.dropDatabase()
